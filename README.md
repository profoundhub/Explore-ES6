Check out my previous Video: Exploring some FlexBox, Angular 2 and whatever else comes up along the way

Today we'll ... explore ES6


Welcome back!


Live coding TV Seems to be down, I will only be

streaming on Twitch until Livecoding.TV is back online.

Good morning, so previously i tried to stream and ... my

computer crashed.

Today we'll ... explore ES6


I will be taking a stroll and trying out how to do some

cool stuff with ES6 and ...

I will not be speaking, only typing. ( I will be

listening to music... you can listen to your own music

too.)

Feel free to ask any questions along the way a s I show

you what i am working on.

I plan to keep these videos under 1 hour, maybe 25 - 30

mins long each.

There will be a few sections and I will restart the stream after each

feel free to skip ahead, if you are watching this later on YouTube.

Plus, I will be uploading to GITHUB.
as i go along so you may follow along and grab my code ...
